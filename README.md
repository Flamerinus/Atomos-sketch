# √Åtomos
[Click here to see it in action.](http://flamerinus.byethost7.com/atomos/)

This is a simple program that displays a small part of the periodic table, with a visual representation of the atom, displayed in the basic **Bohr model**.
The program shows how many particles of each type are in the nucleus and how many are orbiting the nucleus in the outer shells, as well as the number of shells, for different kinds of atoms.

The code is fairly extensively commented and I created it while learning javascript and p5.js so it's nothing special, efficient, elegant or hard to understand.
