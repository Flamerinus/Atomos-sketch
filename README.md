<h1>Atomos-sketch</h1>
<p>See it in action here http://flamerinus.byethost7.com/atomos/</p>
<p>This is a simple program that displays a small part of the periodic table, with a visual representation of the atom displayed in the basic Bohr model.</p>
<p>It's aim is to aid with basic visual understanding of the atom and subatomic particles, and their simplified representation.</p>
<p>The scale of the atom is not realistic nor is the shape or behavior of the subatomic particles.</p>
<p>Neither of the particles are really shaped like "balls" or behave like that, overlapping, dancing around, or spinning in different directions.</p>
<p>The size and mass of the protons and neutrons is much greater than that of the electrons, even though they appear to be the same size in this model. This is done for visual clarity.</p>
<p>The program shows how many particles of each type are in the nucleus and how many are orbiting the nucleus in the outer shells, as well as the number of shells, for different kinds of atoms.</p>
<p>The protons and neutrons inside the nucleus are not really organized in shells, this is done for convenience and visual clarity.
The electrons do get organized in discrete shells around the nucleus in real atoms.</p>
<p>The code is fairly extensively commented and it's nothing special, efficient, elegant or hard to understand</p>
