This is a simple program that displays a small part of the periodic table, with a visual representation of the atom, displayed in the basic **Bohr model**.

It's aim is to aid with basic visual understanding of the atom and subatomic particles, and their simplified representation.

The scale of the atom is **not** realistic and neither is the shape or behavior of the subatomic particles.
The size and mass of the protons and neutrons is much greater than that of the electrons, even though they appear to be the same size in this model.
Protons and neutrons inside the nucleus are not really organized in shells.
The electrons do get organized in discrete shells around the nucleus in real atoms.
None of them are really shaped like "balls" or behave in this way, overlapping, dancing around, or spinning in different directions.

All this is done for convenience and visual clarity, as this is not intended as an accurate model of real atoms.

The program shows how many particles of each type are in the nucleus and how many are orbiting the nucleus in the outer shells, as well as the number of shells, for different kinds of atoms.

The code is fairly extensively commented and it's nothing special, efficient, elegant or hard to understand.
