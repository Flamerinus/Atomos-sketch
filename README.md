___
This is a simple program that displays a small part of the periodic table, with a visual representation of the atom, displayed in the basic **Bohr model**.

The program shows how many particles of each type are in the nucleus and how many are orbiting the nucleus in the outer shells, as well as the number of shells, for different kinds of atoms.

The code is fairly extensively commented and I created it while learning **JavaScript** and **p5.js** so it's nothing special, efficient, elegant or hard to understand.
___
The important files are:
+ **index.html**: Main html file containing all the elements: buttons, p5 canvas, description. etc
+ **atomos-sketch.js**: 1st JavaScript sketch called in the .html file, contains most of the code, functions and variables.
+ **lang.js**: 2nd JavaScript sketch called in the index. Contains the translations and language changing functions.
+ **libraries folder**: Contains the p5.js libraries, also called in the HTML file, necessary to run all of the p5 functions inside the code. To update them and use newer functions, just download the newest version from [the p5.js website](https://p5js.org/download/).
